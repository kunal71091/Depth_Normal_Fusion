This is a sample implementation of the Extended Marching Cubes algorithm
from https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/IsoEx modified by R. Wenger
to generate cubes, annuli and flanges.

The new code is in Apps2/emc_poly.

Please refer to http://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/IsoEx/ for details
on the original IsoEx implementation.

This code requires OpenMesh from www.openmesh.org.
This code should be placed in directory IsoEx.
OpenMesh and IsoEx must be in the same directory for the includes to work.
