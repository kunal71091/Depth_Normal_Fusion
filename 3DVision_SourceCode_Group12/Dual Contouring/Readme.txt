# Follow these instructions to run dual contouring algorithm on a simple implicit cube.



1. Open both test.pyc and Dual_Contour1.pyc and check if the dependencies are installed, especially mayavi.
   
 Mayavi installation instructions: http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/installation.html

2. The u.txt file contains the scalar distance values. Make sure it is in the same folder as the python code.

3. Make sure Dual_Contour1.pyc and test.pyc are also in the same folder.

4. Open test.pyc with idle (or any other python GUI) and run it. Alternatively run it directly thorugh console.

5. Wait for sometime (about 60 mins with this u.txt). After the code ends, the resulting mesh will be saved in test_result.wrl. Open it using meshlab.


# We also provide the link to download the building meshes. The code takes 16 hours+ to run on the building dataset hence we just present the resulting meshes
from Dual Contouring and Marching cubes.
